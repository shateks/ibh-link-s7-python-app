##Road map
I plan to equip app in following functionalities:
* Support API reads & writes Bits, Bytes, Words, Double Words, Byte fields from areas: M, I/E, Q/A, DB
* Cyclic operation of above reads & writes
* Standard GUI for presentation of visualization screens writen in PyQT
* Loading qt-designer *.ui files with screens and parse widgets properties 'What's this' for desired PLC variables to refresh
